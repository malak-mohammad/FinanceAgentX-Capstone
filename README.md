# FinanceAgentX

**Intelligent Financial Automation System Using Multi-Agent Architecture & Machine Learning**

A full-stack multi-agent platform that automates corporate financial analysis across five domains — Invoice Processing, Budget Analysis, Transaction Reconciliation, Credit Risk Assessment, and Cash Flow Forecasting. Each domain is handled by an autonomous AI agent backed by pre-trained machine learning models, communicating asynchronously through RabbitMQ message queues.

## My Contribution

This project was completed as a two-person Software Engineering capstone project. My primary responsibilities focused on the backend architecture, service orchestration, and system integration components of the platform.

### Primary Contributions

- Designed and implemented the backend architecture using **Node.js** and **Express.js**
- Developed RESTful API endpoints to support financial analysis workflows and task management
- Implemented **RabbitMQ-based asynchronous messaging** to enable communication between the backend and multiple financial agents
- Built the task orchestration and processing logic responsible for coordinating agent execution and result aggregation
- Integrated **SQLite** database persistence for storing tasks, analysis results, and system data
- Managed communication between the frontend interface and backend services
- Assisted in the integration and deployment of machine learning-based financial analysis agents within the multi-agent architecture
- Participated in system integration, debugging, testing, and final deployment activities
- Contributed to project documentation and technical presentation preparation

### Skills Demonstrated

- Backend Software Engineering
- REST API Development
- Distributed Systems & Service Communication
- Message-Driven Architecture
- RabbitMQ Integration
- Database Design & Integration
- System Integration
- Multi-Agent System Architecture
- Software Testing & Debugging

This project strengthened my experience in distributed systems, backend engineering, message-driven architectures, and the integration of machine learning components into real-world software systems.

## Architecture

This section explains the system design, message flow, and task execution lifecycle of FinanceAgentX.

---

### 1. System Overview

![System Architecture](./assets/system-architecture.png)

The system follows a multi-agent distributed architecture where the frontend communicates with a Node.js backend, which orchestrates multiple AI agents via RabbitMQ.

---

### 2. Task Execution Sequence

![Sequence Diagram](./assets/sequence-diagram.png)

This diagram shows how a user request flows through the system step-by-step, from API request to agent execution and result aggregation.

---

### 3. Task Processing Workflow

![Task Workflow](./assets/task-workflow.png)

This workflow illustrates how tasks are decomposed, routed to agents, processed using ML models, and returned as structured financial insights.
## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, Chart.js 4.4 |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express.js 5 |
| **Message Broker** | RabbitMQ (via amqplib) |
| **Database** | SQLite 3 |
| **API Documentation** | Swagger / OpenAPI 3.0 |
| **ML Training** | Python 3, scikit-learn, XGBoost, pandas, numpy |
| **ML Inference** | Python scripts invoked via child_process |

## Features

- **5 autonomous AI agents** processing financial data in parallel
- **15 ML sub-models** (3 per agent) trained with synthetic data and 3-way algorithm comparison
- **RabbitMQ message queues** for asynchronous, decoupled agent communication
- **Selective agent dispatch** — run all 5 agents or pick a subset
- **Real-time dashboard** with live progress tracking, charts, and logs
- **Rule-based fallback** — agents degrade gracefully if ML models fail
- **Swagger API documentation** at `/api-docs`
- **SQLite persistence** for tasks and agent results
- **Demo/offline mode** — frontend works without the backend running

## ML Models — What Each Agent Predicts

| Agent | Prediction Targets |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Invoice** | invoiceAmount ($), paymentStatus (approved/pending/rejected), duplicateCheck (T/F) |
| **Budget** | totalBudget ($), remainingBudget ($), approvedDepartments (count) |
| **Reconciliation** | matchedTransactions, unmatchedTransactions, reconciliationStatus |
| **Credit** | creditScore (300–850), riskLevel (low/moderate/high), loanEligibility |
| **Cash** | availableCash ($), monthlyExpenses ($), cashFlowStatus (stable/tight/critical) |

Each target is trained with **Linear/Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**. The best-performing model (by R² or accuracy) is automatically saved for production inference.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+
- **Python** 3.9+
- **RabbitMQ** server running locally (default: `amqp://localhost`)

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd FinanceAgentX

# 2. Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# 3. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training the ML Models (One-Time Setup)

Each agent has its own ML pipeline. Run these once before starting the server:

```bash
# Generate synthetic datasets and train models for all 5 agents
cd invoice_agent_model && python generate_dataset.py && python train_model.py && cd ..
cd budget_agent_model && python generate_dataset.py && python train_model.py && cd ..
cd reconciliation_agent_model && python generate_dataset.py && python train_model.py && cd ..
cd credit_agent_model && python generate_dataset.py && python train_model.py && cd ..
cd cash_agent_model && python generate_dataset.py && python train_model.py && cd ..
```

This generates 2,000 synthetic samples per agent and saves trained models to `saved_models/`.

## Running the Application

```bash
# Make sure RabbitMQ is running first, then:
npm start
```
